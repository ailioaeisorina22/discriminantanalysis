# 💡 Discriminant Analysis in Python

This project focuses on **discriminant analysis** for predicting cardiovascular disease using machine learning techniques in Python.

## 🧠 Overview
We applied:
- **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**
- **Naive Bayes Classification**

on a dataset containing records from **1,000 patients** collected by a specialized hospital in India.  
The goal is to detect the presence of heart disease based on 14 key medical features.

## 📊 Results
| Model        | Accuracy | Cohen-Kappa |
|--------------|----------|-------------|
| LDA          | **96.75%** | 0.93355     |
| Naive Bayes  | **95.75%** | 0.9125      |

These results highlight the potential of discriminant analysis for **early medical diagnosis** and **risk assessment** in cardiology.

Discriminant Analysis in Python 
This project analyzes cardiovascular disease data using machine learning techniques, with a focus on Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Naive Bayes classification.
Based on a dataset of 1000 patients from a specialized Indian hospital, the models aim to predict heart disease presence with high accuracy. 
The LDA model achieved a 96.75% accuracy rate, while the Naive Bayes classifier reached 95.75%, demonstrating the potential of these techniques for early medical diagnosis and risk assessment.
